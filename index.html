Frankfurt am Main · formerly New York · Global focus</div>

<p>
I work at the intersection of private equity, risk discipline, and long-term wealth allocation.
My background spans more than a decade across global investment environments, with a focus on
capital preservation, selective growth, and institutional decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
I am a Portfolio Manager with more than ten years of experience in private equity and wealth-related
investment strategies. Over the past five years, my work has been conducted within top-tier global
investment environments across institutional mandates.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio construction and oversight</li>
<li>Capital allocation across private structures</li>
<li>Evaluation of co-investment opportunities</li>
<li>Risk and drawdown management</li>
<li>Long-term wealth structuring</li>
</ul>

<h2>Investment Approach</h2>
<h3>Private Equity</h3>
<p>
Private equity is approached as a long-term allocation discipline with emphasis on governance,
alignment and downside protection.
</p>

<h3>Risk Management</h3>
<p>
Risk is treated as a permanent variable. Focus lies on drawdown awareness, capital preservation
and stress-testing assumptions.
</p>

<h3>Wealth Management</h3>
<p>
Wealth is structured for continuity and resilience rather than short-term optimization.
</p>

<h2>Track Record (Discreet)</h2>
<p>
Across relevant mandates and structures, portfolios have generated average annual cash distributions
exceeding <strong>7.5%</strong>, assessed over full market cycles.
</p>

<h2>Publications &amp; Investment Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capital Preservation in Volatile Markets</li>
<li>Private Equity Cycles and Risk Timing</li>
<li>Global Allocation Considerations in Late-Cycle Environments</li>
<li>Liquidity, Duration and Long-Term Wealth Structures</li>
<li>Why Risk Discipline Outperforms Conviction Over Time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond Finance</h2>
<p>
Regular walking in the Taunus region outside Frankfurt provides perspective away from market noise.
Distance reinforces patience, sequencing and long-term thinking.
